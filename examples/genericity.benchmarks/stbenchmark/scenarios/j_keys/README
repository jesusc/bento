Keys and Object Fusion
======================

This scenario is implemented using BIO_TGT as concept and BIO_SRC as meta-model.
The reason is that the reverse situation is impossible because BIO_TGT has less
information than BIO_SRC and thus it is impossible to reconstruct the model.

  TGT   -->   TGT

  SRC   --->  TGT
  
Actually, this is what the benchmark expects...
