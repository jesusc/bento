== Experiment

- Change KM3.ecore to include only one top-level package... (we do now support other organization yet)
- Change KM3.ecore to have a URI: amma/km3/modified

- Analysis (First try)

  Error: No operation PARN Classifier : 345:11-345:22
  Fix: Line 628, make helper context be Classifier instead of Class (TODO: Raise a warning instead of error)
  
  Error: No operation CHIN Classifier : 357:2-357:13
  Fix: Line 612, make helper context be Classifier instead of Class (TODO: Raise a warning instead of error)
  
  Error:  No operation NRN Classifier : 377:2-377:12
  Fix: Line 588, make helper context be Classifier instead of Class (TODO: Raise a warning instead of error)

  Error: No operation NAN Classifier : 377:15-377:25
  Fix: Line 564, make helper context be Classifier instead of Class (TODO: Raise a warning instead of error)
  Note: This error is particularly stupid, because SIZE2() is defined over Classifier, and it calls NRN and NAN
        for self, expecting it to be a Class!!
  	
  		helper context KM3!Classifier
			def : SIZE2() : Integer = self.NRN() + self.NAN();
			
  Error: No operation newAttributes Class : 393:5-393:25
  DO NOT KNOW WHY?? ==> Now I know ==> It is defined as a helper, not as an operation (with ())

- Analysis (Second try)
  The analyser has been improved to "infer" the intended operation, so that there is no need to change anything
  except the newAttributes.
  
  The newAttributes issue could have spotted by the analyser, but looking for helpers with the same name
  as the called operation (at least the user can solve this tricky issue rapidly).
  
  Error: No operation newAttributes Class : 393:5-393:25
  Fix: Line 421, changed newAttributes => newAttributes()
