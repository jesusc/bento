    <h1>Flow diagrams to Petri nets</h1>      
    <p>
    This document describes how the FD2PN component has been reused for several
    workflow languages. This component features a reusable transformation from a 
    Workflow concept to a Petri net, which is able to deal with several of the
    patterns defined in the <a href="http://workflowpatterns.org">Workflow patterns catalog</a>.
    </p>

      The menu provide links to the different artefacts of the case study.

    <h2><a name="bender" class="anchor" href="#bender"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bender</h2>

    
    <p>
      Bender is a Domain-Specific Language to describe the workflow of
telephony services. These services include include voice notes and
voice-to-email services; services to inject customized background
sounds in phone calls; the customization of the telephone keys to
inject “voice smileys” in a conversation; as well as the typical
Interactive Voice Response (IVR) applications of call centers,
telebanking, credit card services, and so on.
      </p>
    <p>
      Bender is integrated in the Umbra Designer modelling tool.
      A detailed description of Umbra is available in
      <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-39013-5_13">
      [BEL13]</a>.

    </p>

    <h3>Meta-model</h3>
    <p>
    The following diagram is an excerpt with the relevant elements of the Bender meta-model.
    The complete diagrams are also available in <a href="images/bender_mm.svg">SVG</a> and 
    <a href="images/bender_mm.png">PNG</a> formats.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Bender a workflow task is represented as a State. The two
      subclasses InitialState and FinalState indicate the beginning
      and end of the execution respectivly, and at least one instance
      of each one must exist in any valid Bender model. Hierarchical
      descomposition of states is possible with CompositeState.  Each
      State holds the transitions that stem from it. There are many
      subclasses of Transition, which represent the different kinds of
      events that may trigger the transition.  In particular,
      Collected represents a choice in the workflow and implicitly
      behaves both as a transition and as a state (workflow task).
      </p>

	 -->
       <embed src="images/bender_mini.svg" type="image/svg+xml" />
    </div>

    
    <h4>Example</h4>
    
    <p>
      The following image shows an example model built with Bender. It 
      represents a simple service which requests the user to press
      1 or 2 to perform some action.
      The service initial state is Init, where the service waits for incoming calls once a new session
has been established. Hence, at the top level, the event from the initial state is
SessionRequest (see arrow coming into state Init). The service designer does not
have to take care of handling the Bootstrap event, as the tool itself will generate
code to register the listeners for the events and actions used by the service (in
the example all are IVR events), and identifying the needed resources. Events
are depicted in blue (bold) over the arrows, while actions are shown in red
below the events. The service plays a welcome message to each incoming call.
This is modelled by a Connected event and the associated PlayCollect action.
This action has the additional effect to demand pressing some key on the phone
keypad. Thus, the service waits in state KeyRequest until the reception of some
key stroke (event Collected). If the key pressed was “1” or “2”, the service plays a
different message in each case, as indicated by the Play action. Once the message
associated to “1” or “2” is played (event Played in the transition going out from
Bye), the service ends the call through the Hangup action.

    <h3>Binding</h3>
    <p>
      The binding for simple tasks and transitions is straightforward (
      (Node maps to State and FlowEdge to Transition), as well as for
      FinalTask and the isInitial attribute. The only available gateway
      in Bender is ExclusiveChoice, which maps to Collected. 
      However, this binding is challenging because of the twofold nature
      of Collected: although it inherits from Transition in the meta-model,
      from the binding perspective it has to be recasted as a node whose,
      being the Branch classes FlowEdge. This is implemented by binding
      Node to Collected, FlowEdge to Branch (lines 8-9), and
      tweaking the result of ins and outs references (lines 26 and 38).
