= Generic transformation: basic blocks
	
== Purpose
	This transformation computes the basic blocks of 
	an imperative procedure.
	
== Some terminology
	According to [AHO, sec. 9.4], a basic block is "a sequence
	of consecutive statements in which the control flow
	enters at the beginning and exists at the end without
	stopping (i.e. no branches).
	
== This that can be done with a flow control model

	- Generate a graphviz representation
	- Detect misuses of gotos (in mindstorms is prohibited to jump inside a while)
	- Calculate metrics on flow graphs, for example the cyclomatic complexity
	- Estimate statically the execution frequency:
