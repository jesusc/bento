== Experiment

1- Remove 14 empty classes
2- Apply son PDF
3- Now 2 additional classes can be removed


======================

* Refactorings we would like to apply

- Remove empty class "Feature" -> This implies changing the template, can this be done safely?

- Remove empty class "Classifier" -> Requires specialising general/specific features to Class

- Merge Model and Package, how??

- Remove empty class "Type" -> Requires specialising TypedElement.type to Class
